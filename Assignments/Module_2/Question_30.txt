Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of the super class? B14. Are static members inherited to sub classes?

- Yes, in most object-oriented programming languages, including Dart, you can pass an object of a subclass to a method that 
  expects an object of the superclass. This is a fundamental principle of polymorphism. When a subclass inherits from a superclass, 
  it is considered to be of the superclass type, and therefore, you can use objects of the subclass wherever objects of the superclass 
  are expected. This is known as subtype polymorphism.

- No, static members are not inherited by subclasses in Dart. Static members (static fields and static methods) belong to the class 
  itself, not to instances of the class. Subclasses do not inherit static members from their superclasses. Each class, including 
  subclasses, has its own independent copy of static members.
