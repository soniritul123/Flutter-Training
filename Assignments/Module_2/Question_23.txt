Difference between inheritance and encapsulation. B5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.

         Encapsulation	                                                Inheritance
- Encapsulation binds the data and the                      - Inheritance enables new classes to 
  functions that operate on that data                         receive or inherit the properties and
  into a single unit.	                                        methods of existing classes.
- It supports Data Hiding.	                                - It supports code reusability.
- It keeps data safe from outside interference.	            - It allows us to do hierarchical classification of data.

-> Inheritance and Abstraction

-  The main difference between abstraction and inheritance is that abstraction allows hiding the internal details and displaying only the functionality to the users, 
   while inheritance allows using properties and methods of an already existing class.
