What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both have a method with same name and signature?

-  In Dart, if a class implements two interfaces, and both interfaces have a method with the same name and signature, 
   the class is required to provide a concrete implementation of that method. When a class implements multiple interfaces with 
   conflicting method names and signatures, Dart doesn't allow implicit resolution of the conflict. Instead, the implementing 
   class must explicitly provide an implementation for the conflicting method, thereby resolving the ambiguity.
