Can a superclass access subclass member?

- No, in object-oriented programming, the superclass cannot access members (fields or methods) of a subclass directly. 
  The principle of encapsulation, which is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming, dictates that the internal 
  details of a class, including its private and protected members, should not be directly accessible from outside the class, 
  including its superclasses.
