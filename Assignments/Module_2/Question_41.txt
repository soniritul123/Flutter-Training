What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both declare field (variable) with same name?

- In Dart, if a class implements two interfaces, and both interfaces declare a field (variable) with the same name, the 
  implementing class is required to provide an implementation for that field. This can be done using a getter and setter method 
  or by directly defining the field in the implementing class. The implementing class should specify which interface's field it is 
  implementing by explicitly referencing the interface's name followed by the field name.
