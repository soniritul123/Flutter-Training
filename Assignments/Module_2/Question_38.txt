How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final modifier?

- In Dart, if you want to prevent a method from being overridden by subclasses without using the final modifier, you can achieve this by 
  making the method private. By prefixing the method name with an underscore _, you make it private to the current library. 
  Private methods cannot be accessed or overridden by subclasses outside of the same library.
