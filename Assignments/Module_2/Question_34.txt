Can a class extend by itself in Dart?

- In Dart, a class cannot directly extend itself. Attempting to declare a class that extends itself will result in a compilation error. 
  This restriction is in place to prevent infinite recursion and ensure that class hierarchies are well-formed and maintainable.
