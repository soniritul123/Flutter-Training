What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with same identifier? 
B16. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to sub classes?

- If both the parent and the child class have a field with the same identifier, the child class field shadows the parent class field. 
  This means that the child class field takes precedence over the parent class field within the scope of the child class. 
  The child class field essentially hides the parent class field with the same name.

- In Dart, constructors are not inherited by subclasses. However, a subclass can call a constructor from its superclass using the 
  super keyword.Initializers, like constructors, are also not inherited by subclasses. When you initialize an object using a 
  constructor, the initializers of the parent class are executed first, followed by the initializers of the child class.
