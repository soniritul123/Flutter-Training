Can a subclass static method hide superclass instance method?

- No, in Dart, a subclass static method cannot hide a superclass instance method. Static methods are associated with the class itself, 
  not with instances of the class. They operate at the class level, not at the instance level. Instance methods, on the other hand, 
  are associated with instances of the class and operate on the state of those instances.
